        </header>

        <p>Welcome to, <strong>Project 002</strong></p>
        <p style="text-decoration: line-through;">I <em>COULD</em> probably use a <em>TON</em> of random CSS formatting stuff to make this look nice, but mehhhh, because
        this is going to one PART of the entire website. This page that you are currently on is part of the finished product, all
        the beautiful and actual code is going to be on the page linked to this. Then, I will merge the two pages together to magically
        make a thing that works! Sooo yeah. Also hello!</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Update: Well, FORGET PROGRESSIVE LOADING I'M NOT MADE OF TIME, I'm just gonna
            use the regular, and then use the service worker to cache and make a webappmanifest thingoid,
            then yeah, sooo yeah.I will delete this page and make the good portion the main, soo yeah.
            Also hello!
        </p>
        <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Click me to go to the good looking version.</a>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Ok so I'm too lazy to make a proper list of the stuff I gotta do so I'm gonna make a
        list here
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>&#10003; <p style="text-decoration: line-through; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Rework the brains of the service worker</p></li>
            <li>&#10003; <p style="text-decoration: line-through; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Use the fixed service worker to properly cache stuff and retrieve stuff from the cache</p></li>
            <li>Fix the navigation menu at the top to properly look cool and nice</li>
            <li>&#10003; <p style="text-decoration: line-through; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Add backup boxes on the schedules page so I can easily add more schedules when needed</p></li>
            <li>Make google calendar's calendar for calendar stuff, TIME TO FIGHT GOOGLE</li>
            <li>&#10003; <p style="text-decoration: line-through; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Add more schedules on the schedules page for sports, and it'll have a drop down for regular
                schedules, a drop down for sports, a drop down for special schedules, uhhhhhhhhh its fineeeeeeeee</p></li>
            <li>Link the schedules I made for sports and popular schedules on the home page, ummm hmmm gonna need more thought on this</li>
            <li>Make everything look good on mobile, this will take a lot of time</li>
            <li>Use Media Query magic to make the schedules pop up and out like a modal box on mobile, ummmm hmmmmm</li>
            <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Learn a bit of back-end code so I can create a secret admin console so I can add and remove schedules on the go</li>
            <li>Use IndexedDB to make a secret admin console so I can modify stuff on the go</li>
            <li>&#10003; <p style="text-decoration: line-through; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Make it a web app that you can download by making a webappmanifest, which is probably more important because this <em>IS</em> a web app lol</p></li>
            <li style="font-size: 10px">Read up on security stuff from CSIT, my shop, specifically on web applications and 
                various threats to web applications, and how to safeguard against them.</li>
            <li>Make a map of the school with detailed room numbers and classrooms and teacher names</li>
            <li>Make the color scheme SUPER amazing, honestly this should <em>probably</em> be up higher on the list</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Oh and all of this will take some time, I'll probably do #1, #2, and #3 right now (wednesday, 12-29-21) so I can
            get the SUPER hard stuff out of the way and then do the rest of the stuff, which is easier, later, (except #11 bc
            that's insane), during school. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Oh also this current page you are seeing, is now one of my Experimental Pages!<br>
            Experiment 13:<br>
            Purpose: Provide a record of how I use progressive loading of content and images,<br>
            with the usage of JS to create HTML based on a template<br>
            Status: Partially successful, somewhat in progress<br>
        </p>
        <p>Update at the end of Wednesday 12-29-21, I did #1, #2, #12, #4, and #6 in that order lol, goodnight.
            Gonna do stuff for FBLA now, so I'll work on this site during the schooldays, just gonna do FBLA and 
            relax for the rest of break.
